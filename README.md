# Exploring_Hacker_News_Posts
## Data Analysis via Python

I analyze data from the website "Hacker News" to determine the best time to post for more comments, the type of post that
receives the most comments, and the type of post that receives the most points.  The data and documentation can be found here:
(https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). Our subset contains only observations that have comments, leaving 
about 20,000 rows.
