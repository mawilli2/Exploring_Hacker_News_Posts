# Exploring_Hacker_News_Posts
## Data Analysis via Python

I analyze data from the website "Hacker News" to determine the best time to post for more comments, the type of post that
receives the most comments, and the type of post that receives the most points.  The data and documentation can be found here:
(https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). Our subset contains only observations that have comments, leaving 
about 20,000 rows.

Created subsets of Hacker News posts dataset, utilized the DateTime class to generate frequency tables of the number of comments received on posts for each hour of the day and discovered the most optimal time to post in order to maximize the number of comments received on a post.

Data report can be found in either the html file or the pdf file.
