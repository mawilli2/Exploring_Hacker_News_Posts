    "Hacker News is a social news website geared towards computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator called [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/). On the site, users can submit posts that are voted and commented on (like Reddit).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that we will be using is a subset of this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). Our subset contains only observations that have comments, leaving about 20,000 rows.\n",

    "|Column Name|Description|\n",

    "| `id` | The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post |\n",
    "| `title` | The title of the post\n",
    "| `url` | The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has one\n",
    "| `num_points` | The number of points the post acquired (number of upvotes - number of downvotes) |\n",
    "| `num_comments` | The number of comments that were made on the post |\n",
    "| `author` | The username of the person who submitted the post |\n",

    "\n",
    "For our analysis, we will be looking at titles that start with either `Ask HN` or `Show HN`. `Ask HN` posts allow a user to ask the Hacker News Community a question. `Show HN` allows users to show the Hacker News community a project, product, etc.\n",

    "In order to have the highest chance of receiving comments, it is recommended to post around 15:00 because it is the hour with the highest average number of comments with 38.59. The chance of getting more comments increases by 62% between 15:00 and the second highest hour (02:00).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [documentation](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts/home), the time zone is Eastern Standard Time, so 15:00 is equivalent to 3:00 p.m. EST.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explored ask posts and show posts from Hacker News to determine which type of post and what time receive the most comments on average. We also looked at which type of post received the most points on average. From our calculations, in order to maximize the number of comments a post recieves, posts should be `Ask FN` posts and should be created between 3:00 p.m. - 4:00 p.m. EST. `Show FN` had a higher average number of points, so in order to get more points, `Show FN` is the suggested post type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The dataset we analyzed excluded any posts with 0 comments. With that being said, it is more true to say \"Of the posts with comments, ask posts received more comments than show posts, and ask posts created between 3:00 - 4:00 p.m. EST received the most comments on average.\n"
